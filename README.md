# Better City Events
This mod aims in adding more events for the fall of important cities (or states) while making them available to any country (unlike the base game). It also aims in adding liberation events for capitals.

Decisions are be available to disable non-capital cities or liberation events.

Take a look at the issues to see all the current cities being worked on.
Anyone can suggest a new city to add, description (they all start with basic descriptions) and custom picture for events.

In case you want to add more cities by yourself (sub-mod for example), here is an [application I created](https://github.com/YummYume/BetterCityEvents-Code-Creator) to make the process faster.
