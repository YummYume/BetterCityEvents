# Better City Events
This mod aims in adding more events for the fall of important cities (or states) while making them available to any country (unlike the base game). It also aims in adding liberation events for capitals.

Decisions will be available to disable non-capital cities or liberation events.

Take a look at the issues to see all the current cities being worked on.
