# Better City Events
This mod aims in adding more events for the fall of important cities (or states) while making them available to any country (unlike the base game). It also aims in adding liberation events for capital cities.

Decisions are available to disable non-capital cities or liberation events.

If you want to contribute, here is how it works :
- All current cities in the mod are listed in the [issues](https://github.com/YummYume/BetterCityEvents/issues)
- They are distributed depending on their continent (few exceptions) and then starting country they belong to (few exceptions)
- Code issues are about which cities are in the mod currently (if a city is in there and not checked, that means it is not currently available in the mod)
- GFX issues are about event pictures. When a country has at least one custom picture, the line is checked but that does not mean all cities on the line have a custom picture
- Localisation issues are about event descriptions. When a country has at least one custom description, the line is checked but that does not mean all cities on the line have a custom description
- **Bold** means the city has a liberation event. _Italic_ means the city has its line checked but still needs work (GFX or localisation).

Every event has a base picture (capture & liberation) and a basic description(capture & liberation). If you want to contribute to any event, feel free to add an issue, DM me on Discord/Steam (prefer Discord) or simply in the Discord. You will be credited in the mod's description (if you wish to be).
You can : send a picture to add on an event (with base picture), a description you made yourself or even suggest a city to add in the mod.

This mod will only work with vanilla maps BUT you can easily make a sub-mod for any mod you'd like (feel free to DM me if you have troubles understanding how the mod works).
In case you want to add more cities by yourself (making a sub-mod for example), here is an [application I created](https://github.com/YummYume/BetterCityEvents-Code-Creator) to make the process faster.
